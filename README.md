## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Change Directory to Data Folder**: Navigate to the `backend` folder in your terminal or command prompt:

### `cd backend`

2. **Start JSON Server**: Run the following command to start the JSON Server with the provided `db.json` file:

### `npx json-server db.json`

This will simulate a backend server with the data provided in `db.json`. Make sure the server is running before proceeding to the next step.

3. **Start the React App**: Once the JSON Server is running, navigate back to the main directory of the project and start the React app:

### `npm start`

This command will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser.
